No, but your shallow understanding of my understanding is classic reddit level dumbfuck assumptions, lol.

I'm literally in the industry and have started working with AI applications professionally. I know exactly what the current limitations are, and my speculation about the future is based on my experience. Agree or disagree with my guess, it's an educated guess.

Hot take: your age is personal and isn't anyone else's business.

If you ask someone's age, and they didn't offer it, them lying about it is absolutely acceptable... Assuming they're an adult of drinking age.

Hell, I'm exactly 38 and I don't tell anybody because it gives them the absolutely wrong impression about me and my lifestyle. To be fair, I just usually decline or make a joke when someone asks, but if pressed, ai'd probably lie about it, too.

I'm a weird case. I don't get along with people who want to be friends with a 38-year-old. My friends my age are tired, inactive, and suburban - I no longer fit in. The people I have the most in common with, who can keep up with me, are 26-30.

If, God forbid, I had cause to go on dating sites, It would genuinely be more deceptive to post my real age than to make one up that more matches my looks and lifestyle.

Post Title: How do I [F19] tell my boyfriend [M22] that I'm not gonna quit doing modeling gigs?

/u/parrotfish7:

Lol, If you don't see the difference between a legitimate swimwear/underwear model and porn, you're delusional.

There's a reason professional models don't generally moonlight as cam girls or OF "models."

One is a real respectable profession. The other is sex work.

Sex work is fine. But pretending it's anywhere near as respectable as an actor, model, stunt person, or anyone else in my industry with training skills and competition, like legitimate underwear models, is insane.

But yes obviously it's her right to do it or not and his right to want nothing to do with it and my right to make fun of him.

/u/parrotfish7: 

Yeah, yeah, and minimum wage mentality workers like you are the same as C suite, because it's the same company.

If you actually think those are anywhere near the same, you're literally retarded.

How people are on the internet is who they truly are, free from consequences or judgmental gazes.

If I had my way, they would be judged as such.

I feel like the only person on bnet sometimes who is aware that that drunken panda is actually a human fucking being, and no amount of suspension of disbelief mitigates the gravity of our peraonal interactions, and I treat him as such.

Post Title: Liberals, what is your most conservative viewpoint? Conservatives, what is your most liberal viewpoint?

-----

u/parrotfish7

As a moderate, I guess I should share my most extreme viewpoint.

Being honest with myself, despite the stance I claim and "should hold," I would not oppose a movement to mass murder the stupid. Bottom 50% gone in a button press? Knock yourself out.

-----

u/GreatKingRat666

You're clearly not a "moderate" then, but an extremist and possibly psychotic. If you aren't joking and are serious you should consider getting help. Feeling that casual about murdering millions of people is - to say the absolute very least - unhealthy.

-----

u/parrotfish7

Soooo you are not me, psychic, or a god, so clearly you have no idea if I'm a moderate or not, especially based on an example I prefaced with its contrast to my normal positions.

And as this thread was about outliers that do NOT conform to your belief system, my response is appropriate. You might as well go to every other post and tell them "You support pot? You aren't a conservative." and "You oppose open borders? Clearly you aren't a liberal."

But as to the question of would an act of evil making the world a better place that causes more good than bad be worth it, it's an old philosophical hypothetical, and I phrased my comment specifically. You may need to work on your reading comprehension. Rationally and politically I oppose such things, but humans are emotional, and I expressed a weird feeling that runs counter to the rest of me.

You also have no idea whether I'd "feel casual" or not - don't assume random bullshit about others.

Also the phenomenon of the human minds inability to scale the value of life with quantity is a known phenomenon. Google monkey sphere to learn more.

Or if you prefer to keep your simple misinterpretation of me based on your own flawed assumptions, just pretend I quoted Lex Luthor instead ("Psychotic is just a 3 syllable word for ideas too big for small minds.") and go on feeling superior to a fictional person you projected onto me like most of Reddit does to each other to get through the day.

Post word diarrhea and quote fictional criminal masterminds all you want, you said "I would not oppose a movement to mass murder the stupid. Bottom 50% gone in a button press? Knock yourself out." This is a literal quote.

I would not oppose

You would not oppose the mass murder of 50% of the population based on their IQ. That is the simple truth. Let me repeat:

You would not oppose the mass murder of 50% of the population based on their IQ

Yes. Yes, I do feel superior to you. Not only do I claim, but I actually feel that it's wrong to kill people on the basis of their IQ. Let alone 50% of the population. That you would not oppose that makes you a horrible human being.

-----

/u/parrotfish7

Predictable Reddit response - allergy to recognizing you don't know everything. Doubling down on assuming even more random things about a complete stranger. Inappropriate narcissism and insecure statement that you feel superior.

And worst of all blatant commission of the fundamental attribution error.

10/10.

Fortunately for you, the button is a hypothetical. I also never said I.Q. That is a simple truth. The fact that you can't even keep the basic facts of this discussion straight makes your meaningless "feeling of superiority" even more ironic than your embarassing reading comprehension failure already did.

I don't feel superior to you. I don't know you. I'm not that stupid or arrogant to think i can sum you up based on one terrible argument you made one day at an unknown age.

You also completely missed the point of the quote while you were ignoring my more important points.

I especially love that when you lose several points in a debate you handwave them away with "word diarrhea" and lane change fallacy to other topics. Classic internet loser move.

Let me spell it out for you:

Would not oppose. Would not condone. Would not intervene in this ridiculous hypothetical as an exercise in utilitarian ethics under the basis that the world would probably be a much better place in the long run. And even that was qualified with "despite who I am and what I believe, If I'm being honest with myself..." a reserved admission of a darkest side of self. I didn't describe my feelings, only the action (or inaction) I feel in my current dark mood that I would take.

How you keep making the same simple mistakes while they're being actively pointed out is beyond me.

And before you spew more predictable aggressive Reddit garbage, Google fundamental attribution error

Your picking an unwanted fight with a stranger might make you a horrible human being. My discussion of hypothetical utilitarian ethics does not.

-----

/u/GreatKingRat666

You have exactly the same mindset as the worst NAZIs the world has ever seen.

"Would not intervene ... under the basis that the world would probably be a much better place in the long run."

You are a disgusting human being.

Would not oppose

Hence, if a politician proposed to murder 50% of the population, you would not oppose it. Congratulations on your lack of morals.

/u/parrotfish7

I'm disabling inbox replies and blocking you for two reasons:

Your predictable emotional replies are boring and you desperately need to learn rationality before debating you wouldn't be a complete waste of time.

I have important stressful things to do today, and waiting on slow aggressive online exchanges is distracting to me. It's a flaw of mine.

Reply if you want, but nobody will ever read it this far down a thread.

Don't worry. You'll be fine. I'm sure you'll find a way to convince yourself everything I said is meaningless and you're perfect and avoid any personal growth.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dphihu/is_there_any_case_where_i_can_legally_leave_the/

I am involved in a minor 2 car fender bender, little to no damage to each car, no injuries, no witnesses/passengers.

The other driver wants to wait for the cops and file a report, but I do not. Am I obligated to stay and wait until the police arrive? Or is sharing information (license, insurance info, license plate, make/model) sufficient to allow one to leave the scene?

Does that answer change if the drivers agree/disagree on the cause/fault of the accident? What if the I am willing to stipulate to the fault and put that in writing/video (or at least my statement of what happened)?

Obviously, I'm asking if there's any way to leave the scene before the police arrive, against the others driver's wishes, WITHOUT it being a hit-and-run or some other crime or taking on additional liability.

Post Title: Husband does not want to have sex. Keeps rejecting my advances. It’s been three years… What should I do?

Post Body:

Husband does not want to have sex. Keeps rejecting my advances. It’s been three years…

We got married when we found out we were pregnant. Things seemed to go downhill once we got married and with the birth of my child, things became worse.

We live like roommates, have not been intimate for a very long time and husband keeps rejecting me in many ways. Never talks about anything other than practical needs. Frustrated and in pain since I broke ties with family after our marriage due to he being from another race.

We are in couple’s therapy for over a year now and he keeps making jokes and never does the work. Keeps gaslighting and rejecting me. I’m not in a position to move out or divorce and I have asked him many times what the issue is. He always says we’re in therapy and are working on it but he doesn’t do anything to make the relationship better but expects me to be a doormat and submit to everything. I’m fed up. Overworked, burdened with isolation and sexually abused and frustrated. I hate myself and feel like shit all the time.

/u/TrueGrey

Unless you're withholding significant information from us, like significant weight gain or an abusive nature between y'all, then he's just decided to end the sexual part of your relationship. And he knows that you are not asexual. Therefore he has no valid objections to you opening up the marriage. You can tell him that he can either do the work and fix it or you can start dating. That doesn't mean he gets to stop being husband and father, unless he wants to make the appropriate financial arrangements. Assuming you're in the United States, you probably already know you have a metric fuck ton of financial protections in place if he works and you don't.

Anything short is him holding your sexuality hostage.

## Observations from 10 Years of Friendship
Grey doesn’t apologize. He’ll use the word “sorry” here and there. But rarely do I ever see him express actual apologetic energy towards me and give a full, heartfelt apology.

Grey has made me personally uncomfortable & pressured many times, to a degree where I felt like I wanted to speak up about things but didn’t feel like I had the energy to engage in what I knew would be an unproductive, exhausting conversation

The first blockchain project I ever did - which kicked off my career in blockchain - Grey tagged along as one of the 7 equal members. But he didn’t do anything. He talked big game but contributed almost nothing and acted like he did way more than he did.

One of my close friends of also 10 years - Savannah - and the person in my life who I consider to be, by far, the most emotionally intelligent, and also the *kindest* person I know (yes, she’s amazing) - never got along with Grey. In fact, within 24 hours of meeting, they had an argument so big that I washed my hands of it, told them to work it out, and that I didn’t want to get between two of my closest friends

Grey doesn’t seem to value kindness very much. To his friends? Yes (mostly). To others, not even strangers, but others not in his immediate ingroup? Only superficially. I think. Kindness as a virtue is *very* important to me. His top virtue is loyalty.

When I met Grey, I was morally neutral. I had just come out of a Christian Evangelical household, was getting my grasp on emotions for the first time, and didn’t have time to develop my worldview much yet, aside from immediately getting into HPMOR and Rationalism. Now? I value kindness and empathy. Grey doesn’t seem to value kindness to those not in his inner circle or those that he’s not trying to impress for one reason or another. When living at his condo, with a view over piedmont park, I once saw loudly complain about - and then harass, with my laser, to my shame, now - a homeless person that made the mistake of trying to find shelter underneath the awning of that building. Not even a qualifier, just “haha sorry buddy can’t camp here”.

Grey has told me twice in the past that he literally does not feel empathy.
