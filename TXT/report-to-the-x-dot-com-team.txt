Here's a report I'm about to submit to the x.com support team.

Seems Zachary Thomas Cage is aware that I - and the FBI â€“ Federal Bureau of Investigation // FBI - Los Angeles // FBI - Philadelphia // FBI - Boston // FBI - Chicago // FBI - Minneapolis // FBI are onto him.

Like I say on, Imgur, on Twitter, on LinkedIn, but not on my websites because Obsidian hasn't QUITE GOTTEN THE PICTURE YET - (obsidian admins, restore my websites, please, asap, kthx) - and not on Reddit yet (Reddit: restore my accounts. /u/ditchfieldcaleb & /u/kryptoklob. No? Then you're consigning Ruchika Satyanarayan Tirupahchur to more abuse. And idk about you BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO EVER INVEST IN A COMPANY THAT ABANDONS PEOPLE TO THEIR ABUSERS. IDK, WHAT DO YOU THINK, REDDIT'S INVESTOR AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EH? (REPOSTING THIS TO LinkedIn.)

The information that is likely claimed to be "private" - well, first of all - is not. This is publicly accessible information via these three websites:

1) judyrecords.com
2) washoecourts.com
3) peoplefinders.com

Of note, this - Zachary Thomas Cage - is the person that I'm currently reporting via the FBI tips line literally on stream right now as I'm typing these words. x.com/daddyklob & twitch.tv/kryptoklob via restream.io. @x & @support & @xdevelopers team, etc? I'd really hate it if I wasn't able to submit this FBI report in time because you delayed me. It could be a matter of life and death. I don't know, and that's the issue. So politely? Fuck off and let me do my $0-paying job, kay?

Of note, the person that likely reported this - the person who's PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION is available online? Noticed that I was doing this.

He joined the google photos album and saw the google document that I have proving my timeline / my side of the story.

Here, have a look at some pictures of him, friends, so that you, too, can prevent the youngest and most vulnerable members of your friend groups from being abused.

From. Zachary Thomas Cage.

At this point there's not really any defense left for Duncan Andrew Sabien; it's got to be uncontrolled jealousy or anger or some such.

He literally admits to having anger problems in his google docs...

friends, he's blocked.

please go make copies of his 80+ question/answer document before he deletes the evidence.

kthx! loveyou. let's protect our friends gogogogogogogo.
