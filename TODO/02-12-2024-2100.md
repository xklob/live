[ ] Laundry

[ ] Add court dates for 1v5 legal battle vs the people that I have reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to my Google Calendar

[ ] Add my @FBI agent's OOO notif to my gCal.

[ ] Schedule an email to my @FBI agent to ask for help with my legal battles.

[ ] Resend mis-sent emial to @ESYudkowsky, the @FBI, @Stanford, @GeorgiaTech, and co.

[ ] Organize Dining Room

[ ] Move @CORUSCANT into living room.

[ ] Play StarcraftII &| Elite Dangerous for a bit.

[ ] Figure out how to **serve** Duncan Andrew Sabien (look up his county's sheriff's website, I guess) so that I don't  miss this critically important court date.

[ ] Google for libel lawyers; mass email them.

[ ] Don't forget to eat & drink. #FoodAndWaterAreImportantForLife #HydrateOrDydrate.

[ ] Work on @Stanford @KnightHennessy application via @StanfordEng. <3

[ ] Pet Hela & Loki. They deserve it.

[ ] Celebrate with ice cream once done.

[ ] Continue to set the record straight - that Duncan Andrew Sabien is a liar, and abuser, and that we can likely #StopSuicide by stopping him. See klob(dot)sh for more info.

[ ] Continue to gather together the #OMNIHAREM. @OMNIHAREM.

[ ] Continue to ignore the jealous (ex)metamours and partners that dated your exes *after* you did. Because that's exactly what is causing you issues, klobbo. Jealous people. Remember that you solved jealousy, anger, shame - all of that - AGES ago. And don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. DUH. <3

Remember that you've got this.

I love you.
